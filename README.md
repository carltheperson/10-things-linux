# 10 things Linux

## 1. UNIX - **recat**

The first thing I wanted to learn more about was UNIX, since Linux is a UNIX-like operating system. I also never really felt that I fully understood what exactly UNIX was, besides being a family of fairly similar operating systems.

The first thing I did was to read the entire Wikipedia page on UNIX. I also read [this](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf) original paper written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson from 1974, which was really interesting though I can’t say I understood all of it. After some more reading and some Youtube videos, I felt comfortable that I understood what UNIX was, and what makes it interesting.
For the project I decided to try and write my first C program. Following the Unix philosophy I made sure that it did one thing only. That thing ended up being a program that reverses the contents of a text file. Since this is just a reverse version of *cat*, I called the program *recat*.
